  - Its subclasses include a constructor, as well as an about() method with a character description.

## OUR DRIVER MODS (V2):
* We included an if-else statement for character selection so the character has the option to initialize a certain type of protagonist.
* A random int is created to have a random type of monster approach the character.
* We have the option to view an "about" page before a turn starts, which prints the about methods for each type of character.

## WAYS TO GROW:
* We can add different types of skills and more abilities, enhancing the combat.
* We can add more Player and Monster selections.
* We can add an interesting storyline to the RPG.
* We can add different player interactions with the Monsters, as well as add Player encounters with NPCs.
